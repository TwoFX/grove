# Grove

Grove is an interactive quality assurance tool for Lean libraries (in particular Lean's own standard library).
It is currently under development, with a first usable version expected at the end of the summer. Note that
development is currently centered around use cases required for managing the Lean standard library; making
the tool usable for other libraries is not a primary goal at the moment.
